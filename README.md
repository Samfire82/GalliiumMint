# GalliumMint

Okay, this isn't a new linux distro. It's the replacement for my modding script that i made earlier this year. 
What this does is makes GalliumOS Into Linux Mint without reinstalling the os
This works on Any Debian based distro, as long it has apt like Kali
The instructions for step 1 are on the step 1 branch
